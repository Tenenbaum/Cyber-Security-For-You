# Cyber-Security-For-You
CI432 Group Project

Hi all, this is just an FYI for people about this project.

First of all, if you haven't used GitHub much there are some great tutorials both on their website and on YouTube. Check them out if you get stuck, or just browse the repos for ideas :). 

About making commits: please keep the master branch unedited after intial setup. If we end up with different versions, each version should be a different fork.

GitHub keeps track of editing history, but please be aware of who is currently working each section so that we don't accidentally double up on work or create merge conflicts.

If you find a bug or other issue with someone else's code please notify them and give them a chance to fix it, or give you permission to do so otherwise.

The provisional deadline for completion of the source code is the 29th March, so please have all content uploaded and styling in place by then.

Any other problems, please @ me on WhatsApp.
~Laura
