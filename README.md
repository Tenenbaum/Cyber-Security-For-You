# Cyber-Security-For-You
CI432 Group Project

Hi all, this is just an FYI for people about this project.

First of all, if you haven't used GitHub much, there are some great tutorials both on site and on YouTube. Check them out if you get stuck, or just browse the repos for ideas :). 

About making commits: please keep the master branch unedited after intial setup. If we end up with different versions, each version should be a different fork. When you make a change, commit to a new branch, we'll review and I'll merge with the master branch if the changes are good.

GitHub keeps track of editing history, but please write your name in the comments next to each section you have worked on. This is for the benefit of the teachers who are marking this assignment.

If you find a bug or other issue with someone else's code, please notify them and give them a chance to fix it or give you permission to do so otherwise.

The provisional deadline for completion is the 29th, so please have all content uploaded and basic styling in place by then.

Any other problems, please @ me on WhatsApp.
~Laura
