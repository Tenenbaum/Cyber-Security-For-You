							Review privacy settings for your online accounts. Remember that you should control who can see the information you’ve posted online. Social media sites, online stores and gaming platforms all have privacy settings that you can change to minimise your digital footprint. Be aware that the default settings for many online accounts make your information public. Here are a few guides to get you started:

					<h2>Think before you click!</h2>
						<p>
							Clicking on links you find online or in an email, particularly when you don’t know who sent it, can lead to websites full of computer viruses. Anonymous links can also be hidden in adverts, friend requests and pictures. If you receive messages from someone you don’t know, it’s a good idea to delete them without opening them. As a general rule, if you don’t know who posted something, don’t click on it. If you find a web-link that looks legitimate, but you aren’t completely sure, right-click on the link (without opening it) and copy the URL into <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en_GB">Google Transparency Report</a>. Websites that are currently safe to visit will look like this:

					<h2>Attention! Your apps need updating<h2>
						<p>
							Keep your software up to date. Those notifications that keep popping up to tell you about the latest updates available for your device? Consider installing them. Frequently updating your software to the latest version not only fixes bugs in your favourite mobile games, but also gets rid of weaknesses that hackers can exploit to gain access to your device. If you don’t want automatic updates slowing down your device while in use, consider letting them run while you’re asleep. Not all updates will prompt you that they are available, so be sure to check in with <a href = "https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/app-store/">Apple's App Store</a>, <a href = "https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_GB">Google Play</a>, or look for updates online (<a href = "">see our advice on downloads</a>).

					<h2>Know who your friends are</h2>
						<p>
							Good online friends are respectful and considerate without asking for anything in return. Giving out personal information like your full name, home address or passwords, even if your friend asks, is not safe. If someone you have met online asks for your information, or tells you to do something for them, find an adult you trust and speak to them about it.

					<h2>Accept no substitutes!</h2>
						<p>
							When downloading updates you’ve found on the internet, it’s really important that you make sure the website you’re using is a valid service provider. The easiest way to spot a valid site is to look at the address bar at the top of your screen, if the URL begins with “https://www.validCompanyName.com”, then the site is likely safe. Safe sites often have a padlock symbol to the left of the site address, which means that any information your device exchanges with the website is encrypted - this is extra, extra safe. 				
						</p>

						<p>
							Be on the look-out for fake sites that have names like “Appl3.com”, which try to trick people into downloading what might appear to be genuine Apple software. You can usually spot fake download sites by their lack of trademark logos, incorrect or missing contact details, or even typos and spelling mistakes. Remember that if you aren’t completely sure that a site is genuine, you should back out of there pronto.

					<h2>Be Antivirus<h2>					
							<p>
								Antivirus software is a really useful tool for filtering out all of the icky bad stuff your device gets exposed to online, a bit like wearing a face mask during flu season. Good antivirus software knows the names of potentially dangerous online content and warns you about it, so you can stay away from unsafe sites and stop dodgy downloads in their tracks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Please be aware that there is a difference between free and paid antivirus software. Free antivirus does a good job if you only use the internet for browsing or playing games, but is less effective than paid antivirus, which is much safer to use if you are buying things online. As a rule, if you are using an account with payment details attached (even if you're only borrowing someone's Amazon account with their permission), you should always use paid antivirus software.
