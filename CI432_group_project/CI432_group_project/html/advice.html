					<h2>Privacy</h2>
			
					<p>While exploring the World Wide Web there are different factors that have to be accounted for in order to stay safe! One of them being Data privacy and Identity Theft. </p>

					<p><i>“Data Privacy, deals with the ability an organization or individual has to determine what data in a computer system can be shared with third parties”. </i><u>https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/data-privacy-information-privacy</u></p>
					<p>Data privacy is very important, it stops your data from being passed on to different people and the less big organisations such as the government have of you, the less control they have and power they have over you as an individual.</p>
					<p>Your data can be passed on through different ways such as, social media (Name, age, etc..) email and chat rooms. So, it is advised to be extra careful when sharing your data via these platforms. One way your data can be passed on is through cookies.</p>
						
						<div id = "cookieContainer">
						<u id = "cookie_text">Cookies</u>
						
						<img src = "../images/cookie.png">
						</div>
						
						<p>Another way of ensuring your data is kept private is blocking cookies on your browser.</p>
						<p>Cookies are small types of data that are saved on your computer. They contain data from websites you have visited. With these cookies, people  can track what you have been visiting and also personal information you could have left while visiting the site.</p>
						<p>There are 3 types of computer cookies all in the form of data: </p>
						<ol>
							<li>Session cookies: temporary cookies, that memorize online activity. E.g. online shopping </li>
							<li>Persistent cookies: also, known as first party cookies. Work by tracking online preferences while browsing the net. E.g. remembering login information </li>
							<li>Third Party cookies: also, tracking cookies. Collect your data while you browse online. Tracks your online behavior and which sites you visit frequently. </li>
						</ol>
						<p>However, there are now laws under the Data Protection Act (DPA) and other legislations which control the cookies  that are placed on to your computer. Subsequently, when you now visit sites it will ask you whether you want to accept the sites cookies. You should regularly delete cookies from your computer and clear browsing history ; as well logging out of social media accounts and emails after use. </p>
						<p>There laws and regulations in place to help keep your data private. One of the most recent laws in order to help data privacy of people is GDPR.</p>
						
						<p>
							GDPR: is the abbreviation for General Data Protection Regulation
 
							GDPR is a regulation that has been put in place to prevent your data being passed on to other people without your permission.
							For example: when you are eating a packet of sweets, sometimes you share your sweets and other times you do not want to share, which is fine and a decision you can make. Or if someone wants your sweet, they would ask you “May I have one?” and you are within your rights respond with either yes or no, as the sweets belong to you.  They wouldn’t just take your sweets without your permission. This what GDPR tries to prevent but in terms of sharing your data across the internet to third parties.
 
							Any site you visit and leave your details with, like your name, email, age and address, etc.… it was within the law previously for these sites to pass your data on to other third parties without your permission. Now it is against the law for such to happen.
 
							If you do not protect your data especially while browsing the net, it can result into identity theft.

					<h2>Think before you click!</h2>
						<div class="img-wrapper" >
							<img src = "../images/dontenter.jpg" alt = "" class = "center">
						</div>
						<p>
							Clicking on links you find online or in an email, particularly when you don’t know who sent it, can lead to websites full of computer viruses. Anonymous links can also be hidden in adverts, friend requests and pictures. If you receive messages from someone you don’t know, it’s a good idea to delete them without opening them. As a general rule, if you don’t know who posted something, don’t click on it. If you find a web-link that looks legitimate, but you aren’t completely sure, right-click on the link (without opening it) and copy the URL into <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en_GB">Google Transparency Report</a>. Websites that are currently safe to visit will look like this: 
						</p>						
						<div class="img-wrapper" >
							<img src = "../images/advice_GoogleTransRep_snap.png" alt = "" class = "center">
						</div>
						
					<h2>Know who your friends are</h2>
							<div class = "img-wrapper">
								<img src = "../images/friends_image.jpg" alt = "" class = "center">
							</div>
						<p>
							Good online friends are respectful and considerate without asking for anything in return. Giving out personal information like your full name, home address or passwords, even if your friend asks, is not safe. If someone you have met online asks for your information, or tells you to do something for them, find an adult you trust and speak to them about it.
						</p>
						
					<h2>Accept no substitutes!</h2>
						<p>
							When downloading software you’ve found on the internet, it’s really important that you make sure the website you’re using is a valid service provider. The easiest way to spot a valid site is to look at the address bar at the top of your screen, if the URL begins with “https://www.validCompanyName.com”, then the site is likely safe. Safe sites often have a padlock symbol to the left of the site address, which means that any information your device exchanges with the website is encrypted - this is extra, extra safe. 
						</p>	
							<div class = "img-wrapper" >
								<img src = "../images/advice_HTPS_address.png" alt = "" class = "center">
							</div>				
						
						
						<p>
							Be on the look-out for fake sites that have names like “Appl3.com”, which try to trick people into downloading what might appear to be genuine Apple software. You can usually spot fake download sites by their lack of trademark logos, incorrect or missing contact details, or even typos and spelling mistakes. Remember that if you aren’t completely sure that a site is genuine, you should back out of there pronto. 
						</p>


						<h2>Identity Theft</h2>
 
						<p>
							Identity theft is a crime in which a fraudster (someone who claims to be something else) steals another person’s name and personal information and impersonates that person.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Identity theft is normally a result of lack of data protection and a lack of keeping personal information discrete.
						</p>
						
						<h2>
							Where can identify theft take place?
						</h2>	
							<ul>
								<li>Facebook</li>
								<li>Instagram</li>
								<li>Snapchat</li>
								<li>Twitter</li>
								<li>Many other places online</li>
							</ul>
						  
						<h2>
							Signs of identity theft:
						</h2>
						
						<ul>
								<li>Mysterious/ unknown transactions from bank account</li>
								<li>Finding a profile on social media website with the same name and pictures as you.</li>
								<li>Emails being sent and received in your name.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>
						How to prevent Identity Theft:
						</h2>
						
						<ul>
								<li>Keep your personal data private</li>
								<li>Do not share your personal information such as home address, name, telephone number, date of birth to anyone online you have not met or without the supervision of your parents.</li>
								<li>Change your password every 3 months (See Tab 1 for password tips!)</li>
								<li>Do not make your passwords anything easy such as your birthdate; ensure your passwords are strong containing letters, numbers and symbols.</li>
								<li>Ensuring there is protection on your devices that have access to the internet. Such as; Norton, Kaspersky.</li>
						</ul>

						</div>
																	<h2>Passwords</h2>					
							<p>
								Your password may not be safe enough! If your password is a short and simple phrase it may be insecure. A password should be as random as possible which makes guessing it much harder.
								Passwords that are based upon people you know, where you live and what you like may be easy to guess by someone who knows you. Even somewhat complicated and random passwords are actually
								easy to guess and commonly used. <a href = "www.welivesecurity.com">We Live Security</a> has a list of the most <a href = "https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/12/17/most-popular-passwords-2018-revealed/">popular passwords of 2018</a>,
								Some of which inlude:
							</p>
							
								<ul>
									<li>123456</li>
									<li>password</li>
									<li>1111111</li>
									<li>monkey</li>
									<li>football</li>
									<li>charlie</li>
								</ul>
							<p>
								There are many programs out there designed to figure out common and simple passwords, a good rule of thumb is: the longer a password is, the harder it is to crack. Every extra character in a password is an extra bit of randomness or "Entropy" which massively decreases the chance of your password being discovered.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								How Secure Is My Password.net lets you type in your password to see how long it would take for a computer to guess it! try it <a href = "https://howsecureismypassword.net/">here</a>
							</p>
						<div class = "img-wrapper">
							<img src = "../images/howsecure.png" alt = "">
							<img src = "../images/xkcd_password.png" alt = "">
						</div>
						
						<h2>
							Your passwords should be different and changed regularly!
						</h2>
						
						<p>
							You probably have passwords for many different websites online, and they are probably all the same! If somebody were to find out one of your passwords would you care? would it be for one website you may not care about? or would it be for every website you have ever made an account on? all of your personal information
							and private conversations could now all be open to the public!
						</p>
				
						<p>
							Avoid this and make sure every password you have is different, and even better, change your passwords every few months for added security! A survey of 6,400 people from <a href = "">McAfee</a> shows that "more than 40% of people don't immediately change default passwords". 
						</p>
						
						
						
						<h2>Be Antivirus</h2>					
							<p>
								Antivirus software is a really useful tool for filtering out all of the icky bad stuff your device gets exposed to online, a bit like wearing a face mask during flu season. Good antivirus software knows the names of potentially dangerous online content and warns you about it, so you can stay away from unsafe sites and stop dodgy downloads in their tracks.
							</p>
							<p>
								Please be aware that there is a difference between free and paid antivirus software. Free antivirus does a good job if you only use the internet for browsing or playing games, but is less effective than paid antivirus, which is much safer to use if you are buying things online. As a rule, if you are using an account with payment details attached (even if you're only borrowing someone's Amazon account with their permission), you should always use paid antivirus software.
							</p>

						<h2>Attention! Your apps need updating</h2>
						<p>
							Keep your software up to date. Those notifications that keep popping up to tell you about the latest updates available for your device? Consider installing them. Frequently updating your software to the latest version not only fixes bugs in your favourite mobile games, but also gets rid of weaknesses that hackers can exploit to gain access to your device. If you don’t want automatic updates slowing down your device while in use, consider letting them run while you’re asleep. Not all updates will prompt you that they are available, so be sure to check in with <a href = "https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/app-store/">Apple's App Store</a>, <a href = "https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_GB">Google Play</a>, or look for updates online (<a href = "">see our advice on downloads</a>).

						<h3>
							Using apps and services
						</h3>
						
						<p>
							We are keen to give away information to big business companies to have access to their services, however, should we be giving away as much as we are?
						</p> 
						<p>	
							From a recent study in America, done by the entrepreneur, ‘most Americans - 95 percent - are concerned about businesses collecting and selling personal information without permission. Additionally, over 80 percent are more concerned about their online privacy and security today than a year ago.’ 
						</p>
						<p>
							Services, such as Facebook and Snapchat, can retain images for years after you upload them using their services as it then belongs to them. People have been caught for crime and other mistake post and photos have caused problems such as job loss.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although this may seem scary that’s not the case. These apps are safe to use but you have a responsibility to act online as you would in person and with these companies capturing these moments its even more important to be careful what you post and upload online.
						</p>
						<h3>	
							How people stay protected and what needs to be done
						</h3>

						<p>
							McAfee recently surveyed a group of 6,500 adults globally to see how they protect and handle personal information. Although, nearly 80 percent of those surveyed have talked with their partners and children about online safety there were some serious issues revealed.
						</p>

							<ul>
								<li>52 percent aren’t sure how to secure connected devices and apps.</li>
								<li>More than 40 percent don’t immediately change default passwords.</li>
								<li>One third don’t think they can control how companies collect personal information.</li>
								<li>33 percent of parents admit they don’t know the risks well enough to explain to children.</li>
								<li>Only 37 percent use credit monitoring services.</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Cyber Bullying</h2>
				
					<img id = "cyberBullying" src = "../images/cyberbullying.png">
						<p>
							We know that using the internet is beneficial. It allows us to study, watch videos, play games, share information via social media. However, there are also risks of using the internet and we should be aware of these. 
							One of these is cyberbullying. So, what is it exactly? When we say cyberbullying it is the same form of bullying but it is happening online. 
							Being bullied online can happen in different ways. Nasty messages containing harassing, threatening content. This can happen on social media, in chat rooms or direct messages.
							Spreading fake information about someone or making feel others bad either physically – punching or kicking, verbally or online it is a type of crime. If you think you or someone who you know is being bullied in any way do not stay silent! 
							Here are some tips:
						<p>
							-Inform an adult who you trust if you or if someone you know is being bullied
						</p>						
						<p>
							-    If you receive mean messages do not reply because it can make the situation worse
						</p>						
						<p>
							-    Do not get involved in bullying others  - do not forget it can happen to anyone including you
						</p>
						<p>
							-    If you know someone who is bullying others report them to an adult – they can be your teachers or parents
						</p>						
						<p>
							-    To protect yourself from being cyberbullied you can start with blocking the user who is harassing you but do not forget ignoring it will not make it go away!
						</p>
